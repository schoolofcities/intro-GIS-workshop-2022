The census boundary data is available from Statistics Canada (https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm)

The subway line data was derived from data provided by Metrolinx (2019)

The fields in the tabular data pertain to the following.

dauid = unique identifier for the dissemination area
transit_access_45 = number of jobs reachable within a 45 minute transit commute
auto_access_45 = number of jobs reachable within a 45 minute car commute
population = population (2016)
immigrants = number of recent immigrants (from 2011 to 2016)
in_low_inc_hhld = number of people in low-income households (LICO)

The transit accessibility measures were created by Jeff Allen (https://github.com/SAUSy-Lab/canada-transit-access). Population, recent immigrants, and low income households are from the Canadian Census (2016) (https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E)
